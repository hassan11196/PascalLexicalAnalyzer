# Pascal Lexical Analyzer 

Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language, designed by Niklaus Wirth as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring. It is named in honour of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal.

## Lexical Analysis
Lexical Analysis is the first phase of the compiler also known as a scanner. It converts the High level input program into a sequence of Tokens.

To Generate Tokens and symbol table from file in inputs folder:

    `python main.py ./inputs/source_code.pas`

Two Output files will be generated : 

    `outputs/pascal_tokens.csv`
    `outputs/symbol_table.csv`
